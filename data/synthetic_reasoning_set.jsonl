{"prompt": "If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour?", "reasoning": "To find average speed, I need to divide the total distance by the total time. The distance is 120 miles and the time is 2 hours. So I calculate: 120 miles ÷ 2 hours = 60 miles per hour.", "answer": "60 miles per hour"}
{"prompt": "Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22", "reasoning": "I need to isolate x. First, I'll subtract 7 from both sides: 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7, which gives me 3x = 15. Then I'll divide both sides by 3: 3x ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3, so x = 5.", "answer": "x = 5"}
{"prompt": "What is 15% of 240?", "reasoning": "To find 15% of 240, I convert 15% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 15% = 0.15. Then I multiply: 0.15 × 240 = 36.", "answer": "36"}
{"prompt": "A rectangle has length 8 cm and width 5 cm. What is its area?", "reasoning": "The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length by width. So I multiply: 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 square cm.", "answer": "40 square cm"}
{"prompt": "If 5 apples cost $2.50, how much do 12 apples cost?", "reasoning": "First, I find the cost per apple: $2.50 ÷ 5 = $0.50 per apple. Then I multiply by 12: $0.50 × 12 = $6.00.", "answer": "$6.00"}
{"prompt": "Explain how photosynthesis works.", "reasoning": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. First, plants absorb sunlight through chlorophyll in their leaves. Then, they take in carbon dioxide from the air through stomata. Water is absorbed from the roots. Using the energy from sunlight, the plant combines carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose (sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used for energy and growth, while oxygen is released as a byproduct.", "answer": "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy. Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen."}
{"prompt": "Write a function to find the maximum number in a list. Explain your algorithm.", "reasoning": "I'll create a function that iterates through the list. I start by assuming the first element is the maximum. Then I compare each subsequent element with the current maximum. If I find a larger number, I update the maximum. After checking all elements, I return the maximum value. This is an O(n) algorithm where n is the list length.", "answer": "def find_max(numbers):\n    max_num = numbers[0]\n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n\nThe algorithm compares each element to find the largest, with O(n) time complexity."}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between correlation and causation.", "reasoning": "Correlation means two variables are related or change together, but it doesn't mean one causes the other. Causation means one variable directly causes a change in another. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated (both increase in summer), but ice cream doesn't cause drowning - the warm weather is the common cause. To establish causation, you need controlled experiments or strong evidence of a causal mechanism.", "answer": "Correlation is when variables are related but not necessarily causally linked. Causation means one variable directly causes another. Correlation doesn't imply causation."}
{"prompt": "Why do we have leap years?", "reasoning": "A year is approximately 365.25 days, not exactly 365 days. The Earth takes about 365.25 days to orbit the sun. If we only used 365-day years, our calendar would drift about 0.25 days per year. Over 4 years, this accumulates to about 1 day. So we add an extra day (February 29) every 4 years to keep our calendar aligned with the Earth's orbit. However, there are exceptions: years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they're also divisible by 400.", "answer": "Leap years compensate for the fact that a year is approximately 365.25 days. We add an extra day every 4 years to keep the calendar aligned with Earth's orbit."}
{"prompt": "Design a new type of transportation. Explain your design choices step by step.", "reasoning": "I'll design a magnetic levitation personal pod system. First, I considered the need for sustainable, fast urban transport. Magnetic levitation eliminates friction, making it energy-efficient. I chose pod design for privacy and flexibility - users can travel directly to their destination without stops. The system uses renewable energy sources like solar panels on tracks. Safety features include emergency braking and collision avoidance sensors. The design addresses urban congestion while being environmentally friendly.", "answer": "A magnetic levitation personal pod system: uses maglev for efficiency, pod design for direct travel, renewable energy, and includes safety features. Addresses urban congestion sustainably."}
